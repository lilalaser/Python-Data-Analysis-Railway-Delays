1. Overview

The following project analyzes data on railway delays, focusing on delays in relation to major holidays and weather conditions.


2. Dataset
   
2.1 Source

The dataset was taken from: 
https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/A_high-speed_railway_network_dataset_from_train_operation_records_and_weather_data/15087882/4?file=30853027


2.2 Dataset Structure 
The dataset contains train operation data in different directions from October 8, 2019 to January 27, 2020, 
the train delay data of the railway stations along with factors like weather, temperature, wind power, and major holidays. 


The dataset contains the following columns:
- date: Date of the train ride.
- arrival_delay: Delay in minutes upon arrival at the destination.
- departure_delay: Delay in minutes upon departure.
- major_holiday: Boolean value indicating whether the train ride occurred on a major holiday.
